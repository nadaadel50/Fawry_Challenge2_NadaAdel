# Quantum Bookstore

Welcome to **Quantum Bookstore** â€” an online bookstore system designed using **Java OOP principles**, showcasing a flexible and extensible architecture for managing different types of books and operations.

Quantum Bookstore supports an inventory of books with the following types:
- **PaperBook**: Has stock and can be shipped to an address.
- **EBook**: Has a file type and can be sent via email.
- **Showcase/DemoBook**: Display only; not for sale.
You can add many other types by extending from Book Class.

âœ¨ **Features**

âœ… Add books to inventory (ISBN, title, author, year, price)  
âœ… Buy books:
   - Reduces stock for PaperBooks
   - Returns total paid amount  
âœ… Remove outdated books older than a configurable number of years â€” **loops safely through all books**  
âœ… Fully extensible design â€” add new book types without modifying core classes  

ðŸ§© Extensibility
To add a new product type (e.g., AudioBook), simply:
Create a new class extending Book
Implement the buy logic as needed
Add it to inventory â€” no changes to BookStore needed!
